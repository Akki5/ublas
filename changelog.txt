Version 1.1.0
02 Apr. 2014    Nasos Iliopoulos    

    * Added changelog
        
    * Corrected a big number of warnings coming from stray typedefs. Other 
          issues may be present that are not triggered by the unit tests
          
    * Corrected the banded matrix bug 
      (https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7549) and updated appropriate 
      unit tests. To enable the old (incorrect though) behaviour one should 
      define BOOST_UBLAS_LEGACY_BANDED.
